# Overview 

The goal of this tutorial is to walk you through the design of a robotic arm, from design requirements to planning to a completed design that you could then fabricate. We hope to provide enough context for our decisions so that you could take this knowledge and apply it to designing things besides a robotic arm. We will also routinely reference physics and other engineering theory to verify that the arm will work, improve the design, and demonstrate how theory gets used in practical engineering. 

This tutorial is split up into sections for the various "subsystem" of the robotic arm. These subsystems are the mechanical system, electrical system, and software system. These systems will then be broken up into even smaller subsystems. Most things in the world can be viewed as a collection of systems working together. There are many advantages to taking this viewpoint when designing things. For one it gives you a logical way to break the project into manageable chunks to work through. It is also scalable, you could have different people work on different subsystems, or even entire teams working on a subsystem. That is not to say the design of the systems are independent. Obviously the electronics of a robotic arm depend on the mechanical system and vica-versa. But by incrementally designing you can ensure that all design goals are met and that the systems will work together seamlessly. 



## Design Goals
Before we can start designing anything, we first have to figure out what we are going to make. Robotic arms can vary wildly and every decision about the design creates trade-offs and compromise. Generally the more specific your design goals and requirements are the more straightforward the design process will be. That said, you're most likely not going to know all of the trade-offs of various requirements going into a project and so the design may have to change if it turns out that someone isn't feasible or impractical.

That being said for this robotic arm our main goal was for it to be straight forward to design and build, and make use of available parts that are reasonably priced. Here are the design goals we came up with:

- Be small enough to sit on a desk and affordable to build
- Have a reach of about 12in or 30cm
- Be able to lift small objects
- Have 3 axises plus a controllable hand/grabber
- Have a reasonable amount of positional accuracy and repeatability

Throughout this tutorial we will discuss the rational behind these design goals, and what the robot might look like if you choose different design goals. But for now we'll keep them in mind as we start the design process.
