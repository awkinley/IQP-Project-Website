<h1 id="1-kickoff-and-design-ideology"><strong>1. Kickoff and Design Ideology</strong></h1>

<h2 id="1-kickoff--introduction">1. Kickoff &amp; Introduction</h2>

<p>This class intends to flesh out the process of designing and building a
CNC (computer numerical control) machine as a gateway to the magic of
project based engineering. The project should build skills and impart
grander project structure advice along the way. Practical skills covered
include: terminology, using CAD (Computer Aided Design), design for
manufacturing, concepts in robotics and mechatronics, and much more! On
a grander pedestal: we hope that going through these materials will
impart wisdom about the thought process behind successfully completing
practical engineering projects.</p>

<p>The class is designed to follow my design process step by step,
including useful information and knowledge. This structure affords
engineers the ability to spread themselves only across the parts they
will benefit the most from.</p>

<h2 id="2-design-ideology">2. Design Ideology</h2>

<p>For our purposes, think of engineering as the field of taking a large
group of non-intersecting requirements and inputs and developing a way
to convert them into a desired output. Simply, this definition reduces
big engineering challenges to simple solvable problems. It’s just the
knowns and the unknowns. This is important because there are a lot of
ways to solve a problem and finding one of the best ones early will save
time and money.</p>

<p>I want to set out a few tenets of finishing engineering projects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Simplicity is every engineers best friend</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mistakes are inevitable, revisions are the key to successful
projects</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The earlier revisions are made, the faster and cheaper they are</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There are no failed projects, only unfinished work. The practical
component of this wisdom is that projects that work and work well need
to be revised, revised, revised, and revised again. To this end, it is
in the engineers best interest to remove as much friction from the
process of continued revisions as possible. But keep in mind, revisions
need to occur in specific relation to final functionality. It is
possible to spend too much time adding too many elements. This is known
as feature creep. There is no easy answer of when to add a new feature
or to change a feature, but going into a project with a clear list of
requirements and sticking to them is essential. Like anything, mistakes
and pitfalls mark the path but an open mind and adherence to the tenets
I’ve set here are a reasonable start.</p>

<p><strong>How to Start a Project?</strong></p>

<p>It is always best to start with clear intentions. For this CNC project,
I started with the big picture: what do I want my final product to do?</p>

<p>Requirements (the robot must…):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Be able to draw to a reasonable degree of accuracy within a
roughly poster sized work-area. <span class="underline">Note:
Keeping things vague is okay; but if you aren’t specifying it at
the beginning, always assume the easier. In this case, lower
accuracy.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have an efficient, minimal, and inexpensive frame.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have three motors in total, one for the x-axis, one for the
y-axis, and a third motor for the z-axis to raise and lower the
pen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be easily manufactured with a 3D printer, some basic hex drivers,
and a hacksaw i.e. the end user shouldn’t need an advanced fully
stocked factory to get through the build.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Largely rely on off the shelf electronics to keep costs low and
access to online debugging assistance high.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rely on simple modular parts so that if I decide to change the
final use case or build a similar machine I don’t have to redesign
and print many parts.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>As we’ll get into later, many CNC machines like 3D printers,
laser cutters, pen plotters, milling machines, hot foam
cutters, etc… rely on common kinematics and electronics. But
CNC milling machines (especially the ones that cut metal) have
to have far more rigid frames.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have a simple pen holder that is functional and allows for a
modest variety of pens. (Pencil/bic up to maybe sharpie).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When composing a similar list of your own, don’t be afraid to add
requirements that limit the scope of the project. Requirements like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Can’t cost more than $250 to make</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can only use M3 fasteners (or whatever screws or bolts currently
owned)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is the best CAD software?</strong></p>

<p><em>It is the one that the engineer works best in, but it’s also a trick
question. As of my writing this, the only CAD software that can flesh
out complex ideas in seconds is old fashioned pen and paper.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image85.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Fig. 1, an example of the level of detail an extremely neat engineering
drawing should include. Simple circles, boxes, and arrows with rough
dimensions should suffice. Sketches like this are powerful but can only
function when the designer finds their own work legible.</em></p>

<p>Any engineering project should start with documentation on the specific
needs, both functionally and physically. The fun work can only begin
with a clear list of objectives and constraints in place. The ideas
phase should be as simple as thinking about different novel solutions
and drawing them on paper. Taking some time to visualize motion, key
steps in the function, the assembly, and manufacturing quickly aids the
selection of ideas that are more practical.</p>

<p>The cost of any changes to a project go up exponentially as projects
gain momentum and a base of research. Which is why cheap and fast tools
like this are so essential.</p>

<h2 id="3-an-application">3. An Application</h2>

<p>In one of its most simple forms, any CNC machine(such as a laser cutter,
3D printer, robot arm, milling machine etc) is just a device developed
to move around in a certain coordinate plane. Note figure two and
consider how many motors (or manipulators) it would take to move a robot
from the origin to the point <em>P</em>(3,5).</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image12.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Fig. 2 A Cartesian Coordinate plane with two axes (x &amp; y). Note the
variation in possible locations that can be reached within the marked
bounds of 0-10 on each axis.</em></p>

<p>If you only need to move <em>between the two points P(3,5) and the origin</em>,
that can easily be achieved with a single stationary motor. This single
motor configuration can be achieved in any number of ways but two
examples are a motor attached to a leadscrew (turning the rotational
motion into linear motion) or a motor placed between the two points with
an armature or reach allowing a purely spinning motion to move between
the points. It can be easy to overthink challenges and hard to leave
behind those assumptions. With two motors we have a lot more freedom, we
can access an arbitrary number of spaces in this coordinate plane. This
distinction is very important as cases where we don’t need the
versatility offered by the extra motor can be greatly simplified with
its absence.</p>

<h2 id="4-an-exercise">4. An Exercise</h2>

<p>Exercise: <em>Given a two-dimensional coordinate plane (shown in figure 2),
design a simple mechanical system that can reach any given point using
its own motors. Note at this point, all “designs” should take the form
of a basic sketch showing the functionality and placement of components.
Then design <strong>two more</strong> different systems to fulfill the same criteria.
With three simple designs drawn out, compare them. Which would you
rather make? Do you think some will be easier to program than others?
Try to articulate specific reasons why some are better or worse.
(<strong>Hint: Use paper and if you get stuck try thinking about cars
navigating from top down, polar coordinate systems, or vectors. Don’t
spend more than five minutes on this if you aren’t enjoying it!</strong>)</em></p>

<h1 id="2-cnc-hardware-for-beginners"><strong>2. CNC Hardware for Beginners</strong></h1>

<h2 id="1-introduction-to-hardware-and-movement">1. Introduction to Hardware and Movement</h2>

<p>This lesson is about thinking of the challenges involved in all levels
of getting objects from one discrete location to another with
repeatability. The main focus of this class is linear automation systems
that require getting to an arbitrary number of positions along a certain
route or within the size constraints of the machine. I will also be
touching on some elegant solutions to scenarios in automation that only
require repeatable translation between specific a and b positions.</p>

<p>For this project specifically, we already have a list of design
constraints or requirements drawn together in part one and at least a
few ideas of how to actualize a design. The next step for us is to bring
those paper drawings into the real world with an understanding of drive
systems and hardware.</p>

<h3 id="learning-the-linear-motion-lingo">Learning the linear motion lingo</h3>

<p>Most linear motion, movement in a straight line for controlled
distances, is a combination of a motor, a way to convert rotation to
desired translation, and a mechanical structure to support the moving
parts and whatever is being moved. Typically the conversion of
rotational to linear motion occurs using either lead screws or belts,
but there are hybrids and many other possible solutions.</p>

<h2 id="2-hardware">2. Hardware</h2>

<h4 id="belts-or-timing-belts">Belts or Timing Belts</h4>

<p>The big advantage of belts is their low cost and versatility. Belts are
extremely cheap and don’t have special shipping concerns (unlike lead
screws which can bend easily making them useless). They are almost
perfect. Before I ruin the magic, check your understanding by looking at
fig. 3 below. The main limitation of a belt is that it is not rigid.
Some CNC milling machines will still have them, but they are for cutting
very soft materials. In a milling machine, when the cutting starts,
excessive forces can cause the belt to stretch and the machine to lose
accuracy. Flex creates the enemy of the CNC milling machine: backlash.
Backlash is the play between components in a mechanical system and the
best CNCs need to maintain almost none.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image25.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Fig. 3 a linear motion system driven by a belt. The ends of the belt on
the right and left sides are fixed so as the motor (the large, central,
silver wheel) turns, pulling the axis in either a left or right
direction.</em></p>

<p>Okay you may ask… What about a belt like thing that isn’t slippery or
flexible? Some kind of metal belt like thing would be interesting.</p>

<h4 id="chain">Chain</h4>

<p>Great point. But think about how a chain works. Metal plates bolted
together rigidly in specific link sizes. Can you guess what problems I’m
going to bring up? The three problems are tensioning, efficiency, and
noise. Exact distances between the sprockets are difficult to achieve
with chains because the loop sizes are “quantised” by the individual
links. This means that the chain often won’t be the exact right size for
a given system. This creates the problem of how to tension the chain
while maintaining efficiency. Really tight chain will have the least
play but it will also be the hardest to turn. Fundamentally, the chain
is designed to be a high power and very efficient transfer system, but
it suffers at higher RPMs because of the number of moving parts and it
isn’t designed to transfer loads without backlash. But with all of that
said, there are a lot of smart engineers like you who have found work
arounds that make chain work. Checkout the maslow CNC in fig. 4 which
uses a carefully weighted gantry to ensure the chain keeps the right
tension in action. Maslow’s main consideration with adopting a chain
drive is their need for ultra cheap mechanical components in a very
large form factor.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image15.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Fig 4. Maslow CNC machine which uses a weighted freehanding gantry and
chains that are sprung and weighted for tensioning. It is designed to be
an inexpensive huge CNC mill for wood.</em></p>

<h4 id="leadscrews-and-threaded-rods">Leadscrews and threaded rods</h4>

<p>Screws are typically defined with two numbers, the diameter and the
slope of the helix pattern. The latter is often discussed as the number
of “teeth” per distance. This consideration is important because it is
part of the mechanical advantage the machine has. If you have a very
fine pitch or high rate of the teeth the machine will exert much more
torque on the workpiece but it will also move much slower. If this
doesn’t make sense, think of the screw and its pitch like a gear
ratio. The pitch is really just a way of saying how far the screw will
force a nut to move per single rotation of the screw. The classic
dilemma: speed or power. The reason that a typical bolt-esqe screw isn’t
often used in CNC machining is because of backlash. Screws are really
bolts and bolts don’t need to be very precise, they are designed to be
tightened till they bind and hold in place. Bolts and nuts have a lot of
play. If you hold a bolt with an engaged nut in hand, you can quite
easily notice that the nut can slide up and down slightly. This means
that the rotation of the screw doesn’t perfectly correlate to the final
nut position relative to the bolt. In figure 5, we can see why this
happens. The nut has to be made larger than the screw for it to engage
on the thread and that means that the screw has to re-engage the nut
each time it changes directions. That means that over time, the nut
isn’t moving along the thread as much as the thread is moving. This is
backlash in action again. Figure 6 shows a nut engaging each direction
of the screw using a spring.</p>

<p>The spring forces the two nuts apart and keeps them engaged so as the
screw rotates the nut moves at the same rate even during direction
changes. This is called an anti-backlash nut and it’s a screw-like
system that was standard in tools like requiring linear motion for a
very long time. But there is still something better out there for
wonderful precision and power.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image101.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fig. 5 shows how a nut can only be engaged in one direction at a time,
and when the direction of the thread changes there is some lost linear
motion.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image11.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fig. 6 shows two sprung nuts, in much the same orientation as the nuts
in figure x but as a more tangible solid part.</p>

<h4 id="ball-screws">Ball Screws</h4>

<p>The undisputed king of CNC is the ball screw. Ball screws work by
creating a totally different kind of engagement between a “nut” and the
helical slot. Instead of the sharp screw edges, ball screws use smooth
soft semicircular helical surfaces. They get the name from their
intermediary ball bearings which lie between the “screw” and the “nut”.
In a ball screw system the nut and the screw never actually touch. As
the ball screw rotates the nut is moved along by a series of small ball
bearings that move with the screw until they reach the bottom of the nut
where they are re-channeled around the outside back to the top. This
design reduces friction and backlash as the tolerances between two round
edges are easier to control.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image140.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fig. 7 depicts the ball bearing orientation inside a ball screw nut.</p>

<p>Quick note on how we join motor shafts to lead screws, threaded rods, &amp;
ballscrews.</p>

<h4 id="couplings">Couplings</h4>

<p>The world is far from perfect and no rotating bodies will ever line up
perfectly. It is very important to consider how the rotational motors
will actually connect to the linear rods. This is less of a concern with
belts because they are naturally flexible and work to remove much of
these problems on their own. On a lot of early 3D printers, makers just
shoved aquarium tubing on the motor shaft and the linear rod and then
added many zip ties. Which actually works very well as long as there is
a force, like gravity, holding the rod down on the motor.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image138.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Fig 8, an adequate coupling built from zip ties and flexible tubing.</em></p>

<p>There are slightly better ways to couple linear motion components once
you have a 3D printer available.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image135.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Fig 9, shows a simple and fairly rigid 3D printed coupling.</em></p>

<p>The next tier of coupling quality on this kind of project are spring or
flexible coupling which are manufactured to a higher quality
professionally and are, despite their name, still more rigid than either
of the previous mentions. The reason there are helical cuts that make it
springy are to account for imperfect alignment between the shaft and
screw.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image51.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Fig 10, is a cheap and widely available flexible coupling</em></p>

<p>Finally, one of the best coupler designs is a semi-flexible oldham
coupling. They have a distinct look, the stark color contrast of the
brushed aluminum finish and a bright softer middle.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image16.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Fig. 11, an oldham style semi-flexible coupling. Note the red middle is
a rubber material and typically called the spider.</em></p>

<p>This brief jaunt into the magical realm of couplings is included as a
capstone for building linear motion with leadscrews. Good couplings are
important to get the best out of a leadscrew or ball screw. We are now
at our first real hardware crossroads and I want to take this
opportunity to continue to highlight the variance of engineering
solutions, each with their own reward structure.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-right-linear-motion-system-for-you">3. The Right Linear Motion System for You</h2>

<p>In order to decide on a linear motion system it’s important to refer
back to the design constraints we set out earlier. This should always be
the baseline in making an important decision.</p>

<p>Here are the relevant parts from our design requirements list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Have an efficient, minimal, and inexpensive frame.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be easily manufactured with a 3D printer, some basic hex drivers,
and a hacksaw i.e. the end user shouldn’t need an advanced fully
stocked factory to get through the build.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Largely rely on off the shelf electronics to keep costs low and
access to online debugging assistance high.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rely on simple modular parts so that if I decide to change the
final use case or build a similar machine I don’t have to redesign
and print many parts.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With these considerations in mind I settled on the cheap and simple
belts for my CNC design. I don’t need the force that stronger linear
motion can lay down and I don’t really want the added weight either. I
am also going to start thinking about how I want to ensure smooth
sideways motion. What kind of bearing system am I going to use? I want
to take an idea from other low cost CNC designs and use my frame as a
linear bearing. This is getting more and more popular with 3D printer
designs. Typically these motion systems work using extruded aluminum
frame components and special rubber coated bearings very similar to
skate bearings to ride in tracks along the framing materials. This means
I can have a fairly rigid aluminum frame without having to deal with as
many different parts.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image106.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fig 12, shows a linear slide built with roller bearings in aluminum
extrusion.</p>

<h2 id="4-what-does-a-mill-look-like-electrically-what-will-yours-look-like">4. What does a mill look like electrically? What will yours look like?</h2>

<p>The robot or machine we’re constructing is powered by motors and
electronics so how do we select them and why should we choose one style
over any other? Firstly it’s important to discuss motors. Motors are
probably the most important choice when it comes to electrical
configuration of your CNC project. There are AC and DC motors. For the
scope of this project we can focus on DC motors. AC motors are more
widely used in industry and appliances but are more expensive to control
and don’t work as well with a dynamic range of speeds. DC motors are
cheap and ubiquitous in the DIY community. The types of DC motors to
know are: brushed DC motors, brushless DC motors, DC servomotors, and DC
stepper motors. Brushed DC motors, which is what most people mean when
they say “DC motors”, have no intrinsic position control. You can vary
the power into them, but need an external sensor for accurate control.
Brushless motors are much the same, but more efficient and often much
faster and more powerful. This can be a winning combination, but to use
it in this application you’ll still need a precise external sensor to
check the position. Typically people use either a potentiometer or an
encoder. DC servomotors and steppers both have precise position control
so they are going to be best for this application. As a cost of their
position control, they both lack power and torque compared to similar
brushed/brushless motors.</p>

<p>Servos are really fast and can be dialed in to be precise but most
aren’t designed for long periods of constant load and lose all
precision when they aren’t limited to 180 degrees of rotation. Steppers
are pretty much the perfect motor for this kind of system. Stepper
motors can move forward or backward in “steps”, and they generally have
200 steps per full rotation meaning they can move precisely in 1.8
degree increments. What makes this motor precise is that we can choose
which of these steps to move to at any time. Stepper controllers can get
much more precision by moving to spots between these steps to allow for
finer position control. This is called microstepping and is important if
you want to improve the accuracy of your machine. I will note that this
brief description is nowhere near a good enough look at motors for wider
project usage or even to gain the important wisdom on how these motors
work. Specifically, for the necessary deeper dive I highly recommend the
book “Motors for Makers: A Guide to Steppers, Servos, and Other
Electrical Machines[1]”.</p>

<p>So I’m using stepper motors and I’ve explained why, but what do we need
to use to control steppers in the first place? It can be a little
complicated but really it will always be a thing that converts power and
digital control wires to physical motion, and something to send those
digital controls to that converter.</p>

<h3 id="the-big-picture">The Big picture</h3>

<p>There are three main parts to an operational CNC machine. Firstly, there
is the CNC milling machine itself, the thing we’ve been designing so far
with its motors, linear slides, and spindle. Secondly, there is a
“control box” that’s in charge of physically telling the motors what
to do. This control box is typically powered by an embedded
microcontroller that controls the motors (through motor driver circuits)
while taking commands from the third and final component, a computer
that runs special software to generate coordinates that the machine can
understand. There are many other potential inputs that go into the
embedded microcontroller. There will likely be “end stops” or limit
switches for each axis that zeros the machine so it knows the exact
position of each axis each time it powers up. I also like to have an
external emergency stop or E-STOP. Otherwise known as: a big red panic
button that occasionally has to be stressfully slammed to stop the
machine.</p>

<p><em>Fig 13, is an assembly of a CNC electronics stack featuring power

directly to the microcontroller</em></p>

<h3 id="motors-and-stepper-drivers">Motors and Stepper Drivers</h3>

<p>For the reasons we discussed earlier, in the hobby space, the vast
majority of CNC machines use DC stepper motors. The physics and exact
functionality of these motors isn’t extremely important. What is
important is that stepper motors have some behavioral quirks that other
motors don’t share. Firstly, stepper motors have peak torque at a
standstill andlose torque as their RPM increases. Secondly, there is a
much smaller variety of motors due to the standards created by the
National Electrical Manufacturers Association or NEMA. They use three
standard sizes for projects: NEMA 17, NEMA 23, and NEMA 34. The numbers
correspond to motor width in tenths of inches. The NEMA 17 motor is 1.7”
or 1.7 inches across.</p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Motor Type:</th>
      <th>Motor Size:</th>

</table>

<p><em>Table 1. Note that the typical torque is dependent on the length of the
motor. Also note that each stepper motor doubles the cost of the last
but has substantially higher torque per dollar.</em></p>

<p>Nema 17s are pretty small and weak but their popularity among 3D printer
designers has massively brought their costs down making them a focus for
the requirements of this class. All NEMA motors are available in a
number of different depths which grant more customization and overhead
on the typical torque numbers from the table. Note that depth
corresponds to the physical area of the magnetic surfaces inside the
motor so they can apply more force. For this drawing robot project,
there are no cutting forces so we might as well opt for the cheap and
easy option of the NEMA 17.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>We are finally going to choose CAD software and start moving things
toward the physical realm. I am using Fusion 360 in this section but
much of the information should hold for other CAD softwares.</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<p>Note: The best CAD software is doodling on paper as discussed before as
it is the fastest way to begin to flesh out ideas. The second best CAD
software is the one you are most comfortable with. I have used several
and find that Fusion 360 is the least terrible. I can work quickly in it
and find many of its features very convenient, so it is the focus for
this section. Even if you want to use solidworks or another software
package, try to find some of the tools I recommend here as many software
packages will have them and they are very good at saving time.</p>

<h2 id="2-working-in-fusion">2. Working In Fusion</h2>

<p>When you first open Fusion 360, after you are prompted to sign in you
will see a home screen that looks like the one below. Minus the crudely
drawn colorful rectangles of course. The rectangles are placed on the
screenshot below for a brief explanation of all of the parts they
represent. The pink rectangle at the top is the least important to
explain. All of the icons in the pink rectangle have an information
dialog box that will pop up if you hover the mouseover them, meaning
that they don’t really need to be explained in great detail here. The
icons are all about making changes to or formulating the design. The
blue and magenta boxes (in the upper left and right corners) and the
brown box at the bottom are all about observing the file and it’s parts
and history. The green box positioned in the lower center is the display
and interaction settings block which is the place to go for customizing
input controls, display colors, and the view style.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image89.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The brown box at the bottom encapsulates the timeline of a design file.
This will track changes as they occur. It is empty or unpopulated at the
moment because the file has just been opened. The timeline allows you to
go back in the file history and make changes at different points. The
system will then regenerate a new timeline with those changes, often
without needing to fix merge conflicts. This is huge. If you make a
mistake, you can simply go back in time, fix it and then the part(s)
will totally regenerate from that point without further changes.</p>

<p>The purple box, located in the upper right corner is the view cube. You
can click on any of its sides that are visible to move the camera to
that perspective. Generally it is more useful to click and drag on a
face to move the camera around for more fine control. If you do this
before you’ve actually made any geometry in Fusion, the results will be
pretty uninteresting.</p>

<p>The blue box shows all the entities that exist in the file. These
entities are generally restricted to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sketches</p>

    <ul>
      <li>These are the flat planes with sketch geometry on them that
make up the bases of all of the 3D geometry in your CAD file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Components &amp; Bodies</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Understanding the difference between components and bodies and
the broader reasoning for those differences is key to
understanding the difference between Fusion and other CAD
softwares.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In fusion, no matter how many parts are in an assembly, it all
takes place in one file. The way this one file (generally
.f3d) organizes parts and sub assemblies is within the
confines of components and bodies. A body is any self
contained piece of 3D geometry. Any number of bodies can make
up a component, but generally it is only one body per
component and then, you simply add more components when you
have more bodies. A component is kind of like a folder for
bodies. But like folders a component can have a component or
multiple inside it. This is how sub assemblies are organized.</p>

        <p>Joints are user created rules defining how parts interact with
each other. If you want a bolt to stay in a hole, you have to
constrain it there. Joints can also be used to simulate
motion. You can define the gear ratio between rotating bodies
so when one is rotated the other will rotate the correct
amount relative.</p>

of a CAD file that can be difficult to get to otherwise. Much
like scaffolding in real life. Construction geometry is

important to touch on here.</p>

<h2 id="3-a-few-tips">3. A Few Tips</h2>

<p><strong>Save time by grabbing CAD files of standard parts</strong>. The full
McMaster-Carr 3D file catalogue is available at a few clicks of the
mouse. Having standard hardware from bolts to wheels to linear motion
components can save tons of time.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sectional analysis. Use a plane to visualize the part cut into sections
so you can check that things fit well after they’ve been assembled.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image32.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image29.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Modifying the appearance of different bodies. This can be done by
pressing “a” or through the menu below. It’s helpful to see parts as
they will appear in real life. If you don’t need “realistic” textures
and want to save time to get the same part differentiation effect you
can press “Shift” and “n” at the same time to turn on the component
color cycling tool.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image121.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image17.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>An important step in reducing the number of revisions in any design
involves finding problems as early as possible. Draw parts before they
are designed to make sure they are possible to design. While making big
CAD assemblies consider putting in the extra work to add all the
fasteners so you know there won’t be space conflicts and putting in the
fasters gives you time to consider things like whether the fasteners can
physically fit in the spaces they are given while assembling the real
unit after manufacturing.</p>

<p>Use the interference tool as a final check before 3D printing or
machining the parts in your model. The interference tool makes sure that
there are no parts occupying the same space letting you know that there
will be problems when you try to assemble the modeled object in real
life.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image132.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Note that when the Fusion opens the Interference tool it will ask you to
select which bodies or parts you want to check interference between. I
prefer to check interference across the entire model which can be done
quickly by selecting the entire assembly. The assembly is shown circled
in red below.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image116.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="4-taking-it-further-and-developing-something-for-this-class">4. Taking it Further and Developing something for this class</h2>

<p>The real deliverable for this class is to make a simple assembly that
would function as a driven axis on a CNC system. To do this we will
require a small handful of basic parts. There will be a physical frame
composed of a base board, a bearing or screw support, and a motor mount.
There will be a motor and a moving platform. We will work together to
develop it all. Let’s start with deciding on a useful length. I’m going
to arbitrarily pick about 40cm long based on my desk. Now let’s grab our
base from McMaster-Carr. Throughout this section we will need to acquire
new parts for the assembly either by assembling them from drawings or
finding them through online resources. Before we get started let’s
follow the golden rule: make a drawing of what we’re trying to model so
we don’t get lost. The drawing doesn’t need to be perfect but it should
make sure that we understand what we’re trying to build and where to
start.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image103.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>That central rectangle in the drawing above is really a piece of
aluminum extrusion. So let’s start there and with the “legs” or the
little risers that hold the unit off the ground. It’s always a good idea
to get a central part everything connects to out of the way quickly.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image61.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Note you may have to sign in to McMaster-Carr to download a step once we
find the right model. With a McMaster account we can download as many
models as we need for free. To get to the part we are looking for we can
navigate through the homescreen or just search Extrusion and click on
Metric and T-Slot and Framing. Note that there are lots of profile types
under the envelope of extrusion. For our design exercise we don’t really
care about the specific profile geometry but if you are building
something like this for real ensure you are buying V-groove stock as
bearings will run much smoother in it.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image102.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next find this generic 20mm single profile in the 2ft length and select
3-D STEP and download. This will automatically add the part to your
Fusion 360 File.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image9.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let’s learn how to use the measuring tool to make sure our part is 2ft
long and to see how much we need to shrink it to use it in our assembly.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image60.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The measure tool is very versatile. Here I have clicked on an edge of
the extrusion. The measure tool assumes this edge is a line and returns
the length of the line in the red box above. It will also measure the
distance between multiple distinct points or faces. In this case,
clicking the line is the fastest part.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image111.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now we want to extrude the end of the aluminum so that it matches our
requirements. The equation I used to calculate that value is shown
below.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image46.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can measure the extrusion again to see that it is the correct length
now. This process is remarkably similar to the way we would need to cut
down the material during the real world assembly. Let’s grab a flat face
on the bottom of the extrusion to make the foot to hold the bar off the
ground from the drawing (face highlighted using a lighter gray).</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image42.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can press “p” to bring up the project geometry tool which allows you
to turn physical features and even parts of other sketches into your
sketch as lines or arcs to use. Simply click on something and voilà it
is now a piece of geometry you can use in this sketch. Now we’re
officially moving onto making new parts. Let’s start with a small one:
the Legs from the original sketch. Highlighted in red for your
convenience.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image130.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you want to see my final version before starting, here it is:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image44.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image30.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Grab those two points on the end of the extrusion so we can set a box
equal to that length. The rectangle tool is inside the create menu and
grabbing the 2-point option allows us to make a rectangle and plop it
into that corner so that corner is locked in.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image41.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It should look something like this. Next we need to start using the
sketch constraints. They are the red and grey tools called constraints.
All of them are very useful. It would be worth your time to familiarize
yourself with them, but for now let’s focus on the collinear tool.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image110.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Selecting this tool allows you to make two lines coincident.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image34.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Click these two lines to lock the other edge of the rectangle to the
extrusion. You may notice that the more we work, the less blue in the
sketch. Blue lines are lines that are “unconstrained” or that move when
you drag them. It is often a good idea to remove all blue from every
sketch everytime. For the last blue line left in the sketch we need to
add a “dimension” or specified length. This tool can be used by hitting
the “d” key or in the create menu. Click the side of the rectangle
running from the top to the bottom and click again to look in the
dimension. Double clicking on the dimension allows you to edit it.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image36.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next use the “point” tool to create a center point at the top. We’ll use
this to make a centerline for the mounting holes for the foot.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image77.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sometimes it’s nice to make lines in our sketch that the cad software
won’t want to make features out of. This is called construction geometry
and it will be clear why it’s useful later. Find the highlighted top
left square in the sketch palette or hit “x” to activate construction
geometry. Make a line from the point we made in the middle of the top to
the bottom. Ignore the curvy left line in your drawing, it’s just to
demonstrate that construction geometry is dashed not solid lines. Press
“x” again to make sure it’s disabled for the next step.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image88.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Make two circles. Ensure their center points are on the line when
placing them. The exact radius doesn’t matter yet.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image55.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A cool way to center objects when we only care how far they are from
each other is the following equation. When editing dimensions, Fusion
doesn’t care about units or even if you want to use math to calculate
the final answer (like Excel). Here we are using “d3” and “d4” which are
dimensions 3 and 4. You can add these to a dimension by clicking on them
once while editing another. This equation is really saying
(30.375-15.000)/2 so we can change the individual dimension of the part
but the holes will always autocenter. If this relationship doesn’t make
sense <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-design-validate/how-do-i-create-relations-between-dimensions/m-p/6476813/highlight/true#M67110"><span class="underline">check this
out</span></a></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image7.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now the real advantage of taking this time to make it work well comes
into play. We can change those random filler values from before as much
as we want and the holes will stay centered relative to their middle
point. 30.375 is less nice a max size than 30mm, and 15mm might be a
little wide.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image73.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We’re almost done with our first part. Just hit the finish sketch in the
top right corner.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image100.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now hit the important Extrude button in the create menu (the second icon
on the top command bar).</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image45.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Extrude the part out to 10mm. Make sure that the operation isn’t “join”
or we’d be adding to the aluminum extrusion instead of making a separate
part. This is important because separate parts can be 3D printed without
modification.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image76.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The extrude dialogue box should look exactly like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image90.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now that we have a part, let’s add some pretty fillets to the edges.
Saves material too. You can fillet by hitting the “f” key or by clicking
the fillet button in the modify section.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image137.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can decide to undo changes and modify things at any point in Fusion</p>
<ol>
  <li>I decided I didn’t love the way this fillet looked and that I
wanted the foot to be smaller. So I used Control Z to undo the fillet,
then right clicked on the latest feature on the timeline and clicked on
“edit feature”</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image70.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can now change the extrusion value to anything you want. I’ll go for
5mm.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image58.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If we want to make changes to the sketch we can use the browser to find
the sketch and modify or make it visible again. We can also use the
timeline for this.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image74.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We now have a part we can 3D print to attach to the extrusion as a kind
of “foot” so it rests off the ground. To secure it in place lets get
some bolts. To do this, we need to know how long they need to be before
they conflict with the metal so they can tighten any further. This is as
simple as pulling out the measure tool again.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image26.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Based on the measure tool and the 20mm extrusion profile we are using we
can tell we need an M5 screw that is shorter than 11mm. Let’s see what
McMaster has.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image91.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>These look perfect. Let’s get the STEP file for them to add them into
our design. You can drag components around by clicking and dragging or
by using the move tool with the letter m. When we first place a new part
in a file, the move tool will be automatically used so we can use the
arrows around a part to drag in the corresponding axis. Many parts will
appear at the origin which in our case is already being used by the
extrusion. Move the screw so that it is outside the extrusion. Now we’re
going to use a joint or constraint to stop the part from moving around.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The joint tool can be brought up from the assemble menu and requires
grabbing a point on two objects as putting them together. Here we can
see the screw is see-through because I have already selected it. This
functionality is to make it easier to join things to parts they are
already in close proximity.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image21.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image127.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If the part is flipped, use the flip tool to flip it back. The screw
should now be in place but we’ll need a second one to finish this foot
mount off. This can easily be done by copying and pasting the screw.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image139.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With the second bolt pasted, I simply constrained it to the other hole.
Now that those screws are firmly in place, how do I stop everything else
from moving?</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image28.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We are simply going to ground the top piece of metal which will stop it
from being able to move relative to the origin and constrain the plastic
rectangle to it.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image24.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image122.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image22.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image97.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fusion assumes all parts are a sort of default clean steel texture which
makes things ugly and confusing. As we now have four parts in our
assembly, I’d recommend taking the time to change the appearances to be
more realistic. I pressed “a” to pull up the appearance modifier and I
chose a bead-blasted aluminum texture for the extrusion, a teal green
plastic for the rectangle, and a black oxide coating for the bolts to
match their coating from McMaster. Check out the materials library and
feel free to select anything you want.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image44.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now to keep things symmetrical, I’m going to copy the two screws and the
rectangle we just made and attach them to the other side.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image56.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ah, starting to look like a real product now. Next let’s add the stepper
motor we discussed earlier. Here we have another decision. This part we
are considering adding to the design is a product that already exists,
which means like the extrusion and the screws the model already exists.
If you want practice modeling, I have included the drawing below, but we
can also source this motor from Grabcad.com or McMaster-Carr. Simply
search for a NEMA 17 of the desired length on either of those platforms.
I used Grabcad for mine because I liked the textures and appearance of
the model more.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image112.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The joints are always visible as small teal and white boxes. If you
don’t need to know exactly what’s joined you can turn these off by
hitting the joints folder in the browser and pressing v or clicking the
eye.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Small difference but worthwhile.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image37.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now let’s get back to that motor. I imported it into fusion. Outside
files need to be opened from file &gt; open &gt; open from my computer</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image99.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It will almost always create the newly opened part on the world origin
at (0,0) which means it might be blocked by a bigger part already there.
That’s no problem though because any part can be moved easily by
selecting it in the browser and pressing “m” to use the move tool.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image20.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Mmmmm, nice looking motor. Let’s create a sketch on top of the extrusion
to start the next part.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image57.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here is my final version:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image75.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image50.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We can start to move a little faster here. Let’s repeat the two hole
style design from the last part we made. You can even use those same
dimensions to set these distances so you only need to change one number
to change this parameter on the whole model. Open the parameters menu by
expanding the modify toolset.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image54.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Clicking on it will present you with a spreadsheet that will show you
all of the dimensions in the file so far. You can rename them something
memorable or keep calling them “d4” or whatever else. Here I have
renamed d4, d5, and d6 to more useful phrases and have set them to equal
the dimensions in this sketch. If this is still confusing, just set a
regular dimension. You’ll have time to look into this later.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image133.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The motor has a big ring that comes up through the middle. I’m not sure
how big it is or exactly how wide the motor is in mm, so I’m just going
to throw out some numbers here. The diameter of the ring is easy to
measure so we can use the measure tool again. Open this with “i”.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image126.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next let’s grab the four face mount holes and add them in. I’m going to
use a circular pattern available in the create menu to create the next
three.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image95.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You just need to select the “center point” in the menu and then click
the center of the big circle we made. This is the axis of rotation for
the circle.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image53.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Remember to set the right number of total holes (4).</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image86.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now just make some lines to contain everything we just made.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image68.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>These are super bad and not straight. Let’s fix them with sketch
constraints. We can start with the coincident constraint to lock the
corners at the top to the line formed by the outside edge of the
extrusion.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image80.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next we can use another construction line to keep these points in line.
Hit “x” to switch to construction, “l” to make the line (ensure you are
clicking on the points of the shape), and finally “x” again to disable
construction geometry.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image87.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image84.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next use the horizontal/vertical constraint to lock the line flat.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image52.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next we can use the equal sketch constraint to make these two angular
pieces equal.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image14.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image63.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next we can use the coincident constraint to lock the construction line
to the end of the extrusion.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Mmmmm… Beautiful sketch. Let’s make it real. Hit finish sketch and then
the extrude button. This time no tricks just grab all the profiles and
extrude to 5mm.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image134.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now joint the motor to the motor mount plate. You can use any of the
outer rim holes or the center hole.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image49.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now that it’s joined, let’s look at it. I noticed a few issues
immediately. In red, the motor extends beyond the edge of the mounting
bracket. This looks a little shoddy. In orange, this is waaaay too tight
a fit. But in blue, it’s nice that there is room for the motor leads to
leave the motor. I have definitely forgotten that before.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image114.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The side view again shows issues. The motor is too tight against the
wall and our foot design is far too short. First things first. Let’s go
in and edit the sketch again. It’s important to expect mistakes, look
for them, and tackle them quickly.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image79.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hit edit sketch on the timeline here. This can be more convenient than
using the browser if you just sketched it.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image39.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I changed the diameter of the big circle to make it bigger, changed the
main offset to 22mm and removed the equal lengths of the square members
in favor of a second bottom dimension. The specifics of how it works are
less important than the final product.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image125.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Click finish sketch and look at the software automatically fix
everything. What a nice looking motor mount.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image119.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It now looks really nice and doesn’t raise any red flags for me. This
motor will fit nicely in this mount. To celebrate before we deal with
the foot, let’s add some flourish to the part. I used the filet menu and
the appearance menu from before to make it look more polished. The motor
mounts with M3 screws. Pick ‘em up from McMaster (10mm long)</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image19.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Copied and pasted the screws three times, colored them black, and used
joints to position them in the holes.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image72.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Really looking great.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image75.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let’s make the foot longer now. First we measure the difference to get a
minimum foot value. 14.20mm. So the foot has to be longer than that.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image71.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’m going to roll back the history to right after we first made the part
in the timeline.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image62.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I made a sketch right on the plane the screw heads are resting on and
made a circle bigger than the screw head around each of them.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image131.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I then extruded the part around the screws out to 15mm.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image105.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now cut back to the current time in the timeline. “Roll history marker
here”</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image43.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is really starting to look great. I mean that. You’re doing a great
job.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image108.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now we have a structure, a finished motor mount, and a motor to play
with. Let’s get the last round of parts before we’re finished. We’ll
need <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/3764N101/"><span class="underline">a cable
pulley</span></a> for the stepper
motor, <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/3693N11/"><span class="underline">the same pulley
but</span></a> a version with bearings
instead of one designed to lock into position around the motor shaft,
and we’ll need some <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/5537T353/"><span class="underline">bearings that can
slide</span></a> in the aluminum
extrusion. This kind of 20mm profile is often called 2020 for short. As
usual, you can rely on McMaster for it but if you actually want to build
this in real life, one can often find cheaper versions of these parts on
other sites with slightly different configurations. Note that this
configuration has a belt idler with a larger diameter or number of teeth
than the pulley. This will cause a slight discrepancy in distance
traveled by the end effector. This can be tuned out with step
calibration but if you want to build the real thing, find an idler with
the same number of teeth. Sets of these are ubiquitous on platforms like
Amazon from companies with lesser reputations. For our purposes those
will work fine.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image48.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I joined the cable pulley to the motor head here. It is high on the
motor shaft to avoid hitting the bolts securing the motor in place.
Check to see that it actually clears them.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image118.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now measure the offset from the flat top of the extrusion to see how far
to mount the idler on the other side of the extrusion.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image92.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We’re going to start moving faster now again as you start to understand
the process. The next part needs to hold the tensioner / idler for the
pulley. Included is the usual highlighted part from the drawing.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image82.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I made this sketch for the bottom.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image98.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I then extruded it out to 5mm and made a second sketch plane on the top
plane of the newly extruded part.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image40.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now make a simple sketch to adapt the M5 nut securing part to a hole for
the idler securing screw. Read further if this doesn’t make sense so you
can see it come together in picture form.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image136.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Extrude the outer circle through to the inner circle the distance we
measured - the 5mm of thickness already in the bottom and the 1.2mm
thickness of the bottom of the idler. This comes out to 4.55mm despite
what the image says. I made a mistake forgetting to account for the
pulley thickness.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image38.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Correction: this height should be 4.55 (5.75 in the image was a mistake
I fixed later in mine) to account for the rim of the pulley. I added a
chamfer here (like a straight fillet) to make it look better and use
less material.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image117.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This bottom height should also be 4.55. I textured it and added a nut
from McMaster for the bottom</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image129.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Made sure the nut was properly joined to the part.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I then took the idler and joined it to the top. But it still needs a
screw to mount to. I measured the distance between the top of the pulley
and the bottom of the part for a maximum screw length and went to
McMaster for it.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image120.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is really starting to come together.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image67.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The final part is a slider block for the extrusion. The drawing below
shows the initial size.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image124.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image78.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I also added lines centered at 21mm apart to my drawing for a slot so
the part wouldn’t interfere with the extrusion. I extruded one side up
with the hex holes cleared out. I also forgot to make this a new
component, not just a new body. We’ll deal with that in a minute.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image10.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then, since the first extrusion made the sketch automatically disappear,
I made it visible again so I could extrude different geometry on the
other side of the part from the same sketch.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image23.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image35.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I then made a second sketch for the last part because I was slightly
lazy. It is possible and fairly easy to make this part in one sketch
though.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image13.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We can fix that body/component mistake by expanding “bodies” in the
browser and clicking on create components from bodies.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image123.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I colored it, added chamfers &amp; fillets, brought in the correct parts &amp;
joined them, and prepared for a new type of joint. Click one of the ends
of the new cart part as the first part of the joint.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image18.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next grab the top front point of the motor controller.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you’ve done this successfully, your joint will make the two pieces
join at the front as shown below. But not all is finished yet. If you go
into the motion tab of the joint menu and select “slider” you can set
the motion platform to move back and forth in the Y. The motions will
have a short animation to demonstrate what axis is moving. This can be
useful as our axes may not be consistent.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now you can click and drag the table around to move it.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image93.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally, we can jump over to the render workspace.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image31.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Select scene settings and move around the position of the environmental
light to make some nice glossy reflective surfaces shine.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image27.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hit the render button in whatever aspect ratio you like. If you have a
student license, you can have autodesk do the actual rendering
computation and it’ll probably look better. Just remember to set the
resolution how you want it. Hit the big blue render button in the bottom
right corner and wait a few minutes.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image128.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And violà! We have a finished product. Looks a lot nicer than that
first drawing, but which took more time?</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image65.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A ton of re-configurations are possible just watch out for the belt
routing.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image94.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is through this method that I arrived at a slightly modified final
design for my project. Okay so you have the basics of CAD design in the
book. What resources are there to go further and how do I know my parts
will work after they’ve been manufactured? The answer to the first
question is just put time into it. Find project ideas that interest you
and figure out what buttons do. As for the second question, let’s talk
about design for manufacturing.</p>

<h2 id="2-3d-printing">2. 3D Printing</h2>

<h3 id="the-basics">The Basics</h3>

<p>3D printers lay down plastic in thin lines that bead together as they
dry, forming a strong bond. These bodies can be very complex and
customizable as long as they are smaller than the build area of whatever
printer you are using (typically a 20cm edged cube). But keep in mind
that FDM printing is really slow and can be less accurate than other
forms of manufacturing. 3D printers are most accurate in the X-Y plane.
With distortion and layer thickness reducing the resolution. So you may
be tempted to design parts in thin assembly ready plates that utilize
the accuracy constraints on the Z. That is the smart way to work. But
instead of 3D printing those parts it is better to cut them out on the
laser cutter because thin wood is often stronger than thin plastic and
importantly the part will come off the bed in far less time. But if you
are set on 3D printing, then understand the differences between the
plastics and the significance of print slice settings.</p>

<h3 id="designing-parts-to-be-3d-printed">Designing Parts to be 3D Printed</h3>

<h4 id="geometry">Geometry</h4>

<h5 id="bridging">Bridging</h5>

<p>Is when the printer has to lay out plastic between two supported points.
This causes the plastic to sag in these places during the printing
process. This process happens the most on vertical axis holes found in
the walls of items printed going up on the Z-axis.</p>

<p>Solutions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Make the distances involved really small.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use support material, which will be generated by the slicer.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Support material is additional plastic extruded to ensure that
the part doesn’t sag, it is then removed after the printing
process. Removing it can be hard without damaging the part and
it will always leave a mark on the surfaces it has been
removed from.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the day, some sag or marks will always be noticeable
on parts unless the bridges are reduced to 0.25”/5mm or less.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3D hubs suggests that an advanced solution is to separate a part
into several pieces to be assembled after printing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="vertical-axis-holes">Vertical Axis Holes</h5>

<p>When you put a hole in the side of a 3D printed part, be ready for the
hole to be under size by a decent margin.</p>

<p>The reasons for this are fairly simple (3Dhubs). As the nozzle prints
the perimeter of a vertical axis hole, it compresses the newly printed
layer down onto the existing build layers to help improve adhesion. The
compressing force from the nozzle deforms the extruded round layer shape
from a circle into a wider and flatter shape (see image below). This
increases the area of contact with the previously printed layer
(improving adhesion), but also increases the width of the extruded
segment. The result of this is a decrease in the diameter of the hole
that is being printed. This issue is particularly bad, when the holes
are smaller relative to the nozzle. Think 3mm holes.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image109.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This effect can be accounted for in slicers and even on printer
firmware, but since you are likely working on educational equipment.
Expect the worse end of that spectrum.</p>

<p>Solutions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If the diameter is not critical, aka the bolt/screw needs to be a
slip fit, then just make the hole oversized in the slicer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the diameter needs to be exact, CAD the hole actual size and
then drill it out when the print comes off the bed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="overhangs">Overhangs</h5>

<p>This is an annoying one. Overhang causes a lot of problems in FDM
printing. It occurs when a material is printed only partially supported
by the layer below. It is a lot like bridging but more troublesome. It
is normally fine to print up to 45 degrees. As you can tell at 45
degrees a new layer is half supported by the previous layer. Note that a
side effect of this is uneven cooling causing the tip to trend towards
drifting up.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image83.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Solutions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Similar to bridging, use supports or prepare for the worst.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can also avoid this by designing parts without overhang.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="corners">Corners</h5>

<p>Keep in mind that no 3d printed outside edge is ever going to be
perfectly square because the nozzle extruders cylindrical plastic. (Most
machines have a 0.4mm nozzle, though it is replaceable and smaller ones
can be purchased making this issue smaller and less noticeable.) This is
important if you are trying to design parts to slide together. Another
important factor is this weird effect called elephant’s foot. Wherein
the first layer of the print is pushed into the bed by the nozzle
causing it to spread out a little over the rest of the wall.

<p>Solutions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3D Hubs: If assembly or overall dimensions are critical to the
function of an FDM part, include a 45o degree chamfer or radius on
all edges touching the build plate. For high precision form &amp; fit
testing, use a different machine or be ready for some trial and
error.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="fitted-pins">Fitted Pins</h5>

<p>Think the top of a LEGO stud fitting into another. These features are
often used to ensure that parts designed to press fit are lined up
properly. To shorten a lot of information. Always make them &gt;5mm in
diameter, otherwise they will be extremely brittle. This really goes for
all small features. Make them big enough to be useful.</p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you need a really small pin, add a fillet at the base to shift
the stress point up the length of the rod.</li>

<p>3D Hubs gives this <a href="https://www.hubs.com/knowledge-base/key-design-considerations-3d-printing/"><span class="underline">convenient list of rules of
thumb</span></a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If a bridge exceeds 5mm, sagging or marks from support material
can occur. Splitting the design or post-processing can eliminate
this issue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For critical vertical hole diameters, drilling after printing is
recommended if high accuracy is desirable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The addition of support will allow FDM printers to print wall
angles greater than 45 degrees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Include a 45 degree chamfer or radius on all edges of an FDM part
touching the build plate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For applications with small vertical pins, add a small fillet at
the base or consider inserting an off the shelf pin into a printed
hole instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Splitting a model, re-orientating holes, and specifying build
direction are all factors that can lower cost, speed up the
printing process, and improve the strength and print quality of a
design.</p>

<p>Charts like this provide really nice numbers for manufacturing and CAD
based on what you want to use the screws for. Keep in mind the top,
where it says close fit, medium fit, and free fit. If you want a chart
like this for non-metric screw sizes… Don’t use non-metric screw sizes
(or google it and be judged by future generations for millenia to come).</p>

<h3 id="slicing-3d-prints">Slicing 3D Prints</h3>

<h4 id="file-selection">File Selection</h4>

<p>All 3D prints start with a 3D model, that model is generally in the .STL
format. In order to send the model to the printer it has to be sliced,
or converted into motion coordinates for the machine to interpret. This
process is called slicing and the programs that do it are called
slicers. This is useful as frontend information because lots of settings
between you exporting a 3D printed model and the model going to the
printer can be edited or optimized for strength or weight. The main ones
to consider are:</p>

<h4 id="infill-percentage">Infill percentage</h4>

<p>Infill percentage is almost certainly the most important characteristic
to manage while slicing a new 3D Print. It is the amount of plastic fill
that is used inside of the part. 20% infill is strong enough for the
majority of 3D prints which is why that is the default setting on almost
every slicer. If you need to make a very light part you can drop the
infill or if you are making a very small load bearing part, you may need
to increase the infill. Note in the figure below the red lines inside
the outer shell on the left figure and then their disappearance on the
right. That is the infil level going from a geometric 20% to a barebones
0%. Basically the stronger you need the part to be, the higher the
infill should be.</p>

<h3><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image81.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image104.jpg" alt="" /></h3>

<h4 id="coordination-or-relative-position-and-supports">Coordination or relative position (and supports)</h4>

<p>This one is simple but important. As mentioned earlier, the printer has
the most resolution on the ground X-Y plane. So it is an important
decision how the part is oriented. Ideally orientation of printing has
been a consideration throughout the design process. The sooner you think
about this the better. Note in the figure to the right how the layers
going up are very low resolution. Causing the outside of the drum to be
very rough. Features that require accuracy in the Z axis are going to be
rougher than those that only require accuracy in the X-Y axes. To
further illustrate this, notice how the circle in the next figure is
much smoother.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image96.png" alt="" /><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image33.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="shell-thickness">Shell Thickness</h4>

<p>This is a really simple one that you basically never need to worry
about, but should know is tweakable anyway. In the figure below you see
a cross section of a sliced part with the infil in red and the outside
layers in yellow. The shell thickness is the width of the outside wall
as circled in the picture. You never need to worry about messing this
unless you are printing without infill.</p>

<h3 id="-1"><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image59.png" alt="" /></h3>

<h4 id="layer-height">Layer Height</h4>

<p>This is another fairly simple one. The reason it is below shell
thickness is because it doesn’t have the power to compromise the
integrity of the part. Just exponentially increase the amount of time it
will take to print. If you have a small part, print it at 0.10-0.20, for
really big stuff go up to 0.3-0.35. Low layer heights result in passes
on the machine making high res parts take forever to print, print at low
resolution whenever you can.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/CNCMachine/image69.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="scale">Scale</h4>

<p>Just keep in mind that you can scale parts in the slicer without having
to edit the actual design file. Allowing for quick customization for
cosmetic parts like models, jewelry, or name plates.</p>

<h3 id="life-in-plastic">Life in Plastic</h3>

<p>Now onto a slightly less useful and interesting part of the lesson:
Plastic choice. This can seem like a pretty mundane and useless decision
to make during an engineering project, but it can make quite the
difference.</p>

<h4 id="pla">PLA</h4>

<p>Hassle: very low, 15$ per roll, non-translucent, glossy coloring</p>

<p>Is the cheapest filament or plastic by far. Always start with PLA to
make sure the dimensions are right for a part you are making because it
is the cheapest to replace. It also prints in the highest quality so
cosmetic parts are best kept in the warm and fuzzy realm of printing
with PLA. It is also the weakest mainstream printer filament and the
easiest to melt. On a warm summer day it will get soft and lose form
(don’t leave PLA in a warm car).</p>

<p>Additional bonus when working with PLA, it is biodegradable.</p>

<h4 id="abs">ABS</h4>

<p>Hassle: pretty high, 23$ per spool, non-translucent, glossy coloring</p>

<p>ABS is much harder to print than PLA so parts that are supposed to look
very smooth and professional should probably stick to PLA. But it is
stronger for applications where high yield strength is necessary, it
also won’t soften on a warm day, making it much more useful for
applications involving nichrome wire or other instances of induced
heating.</p>

<h4 id="petg">PETG</h4>

<p>Hassle: pretty low, 27$ per spool, translucent, glossy coloring</p>

<p>PETG is a slightly modified version of the plastic that most bottles are
made from, modified to be clearer and less brittle. It is stronger again
than ABS, it cannot be overheated and made brittle, it can be
sterilized, it is more impact resistant and it doesn’t soften under
intense radioactive conditions.</p>

<p>Not that the cost increase may not seem like a big deal, it is really
more the hassle increase due to how hard getting non-pla materials to
stick is.</p>

<h4 id="weird-other-stuff">Weird Other Stuff</h4>

<p>There are lots of other filaments with properties like even more
strength than PETG, actually being clear, having embedded materials like
wood, stone, or ceramics, etc… All of these are more expensive, will
wear your machines down faster, and may require temps your machine can’t
reach but they are all really cool. Do some research.</p>

<h2 id="4-design-for-manufacturing-with-cnc">4. Design for manufacturing with CNC</h2>

<p>One potential use for this class is to design a DIY cnc milling machine
and this section is really only useful if you want to go that far or
take the time to machine the parts we’ve been working on in this class.
The process of DFM for milling is very different from 3D printing and
ultimately much more difficult. I recommend getting a good idea of what
cnc machining looks like and the way it works for this to be a really
effective use of time.</p>

<h2 id="2-safety-concerns-equipment-and-material-handling">2. Safety Concerns, Equipment, and Material Handling</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-to-safe-cnc-operation">Introduction to Safe CNC Operation</h3>

<p>Something to keep in mind about machining is that it doesn’t compare too
well to other forms of manufacturing available to makers. Processes like
3D printing, laser cutting, and even plasma cutting have far fewer
variables to consider and can generally be nearly totally automated. The
stakes of plasma cuts, 3D prints, and laser cutting failures are also
generally fairly well constrained to poor performance and perhaps a
small chance of fire or dangerous fumes. CNC milling or machining really
raises the bar in this regard. The first things to consider are crashes
which can happen at high speeds sending airborne shrapnell in near
random directions. These occur when the cutting tool hits the wrong
thing or isn’t moving too fast or isn’t moving fast enough. Everything
in the equation can be a projectile: the material, the things holding
the material, to the cutting tool or end mill, etc… Next the fumes and
fire risks need to be accounted for. Lots of materials create hazardous
dust or chips when machined that need containment.</p>

<h2 id="3-a-note-on-materials-handling-and-selection">3. A Note on Materials Handling and Selection</h2>

<p>After a maker moves past exclusive use of 3D printers, they need to get
into the habit of doing some basic research on any and all materials
they are interacting with. Any spool on a 3D printer is a heavily vetted
and researched item. The versatility of more advanced maker tools comes
with costs. Almost anything can be machined but since most materials
aren’t designed or sold for the sole purpose of CNC, it can take time to
find the safety information you may need. And taking that time is always
worthwhile.</p>

<h3 id="device-specifics">Device Specifics</h3>

<h4 id="laser-cutters">Laser Cutters</h4>

<p>Many materials are available as thin, hard, sheets, but not all of them
are well suited to laser cutters. Optimal choices for laser cutting will
“vaporize” instead of melting under the extreme heat of the laser. Many
plastics, especially those commonly used for food storage like HDPE and
Polycarbonate melt and burn causing terrible quality parts and high risk
of damage to a laser cutter and exposure to fairly toxic fumes[2]. It
is always a good idea to make sure a material you want to laser cut is
either on the “machine approved list of materials” or checking elsewhere
that it has behavior similar to materials that are. The main dangers
from laser cutters are eye damage, risk of combustion, and fume
exposure. Most laser cutters are fully enclosed in a protective shield
and have a vacuum pump pulling air out of the enclosure and filtering
it. If a laser cutter is missing one or both of these it is a good idea
to use a light respirator mask and laser rated shaded safety glasses. As
for combustion risks, they are low if you have done your research on the
material you’re cutting but it’s always a good idea to know where the
fire extinguisher is located.</p>

<h4 id="plasma-cutters">Plasma Cutters</h4>

<p>Plasma cutters work by using accelerated super heated electrically
ionized gas to cut through conductive metals. The limitation that the
work pieces need to be conductive metals keeps things pretty simple
here. The usual conductive metal suspects mild/tool Steel, Iron,
Aluminum, Brass, Copper, and Stainless are all chemically stable and
relatively safe. However, the interaction between the plasma and the
metal is extremely dangerous. The bright arcs require welding visors to
protect our sensitive eyes and the extreme heat and force of the plasma
creates sparks and can create airborne chunks of superheated metal. When
plasma cutting, ensure you’re wearing the proper safety equipment for
welding the equivalent material. This includes, long sleeves to block
from small burning fragments and from high UV exposure, a welding visor,
and a respirator mask for fine dust and metal impurities made airborne
by the heat.</p>

<h4 id="milling-machines">Milling Machines</h4>

<p>As mentioned before the big general safety concerns with CNC milling
involve the end mills (milling machine specific drill bits for lateral
and vertical cutting instead of just vertical) breaking during
operation. This generally happens because the machine programmer (you)
has fallen into one of thousands of pitfalls. For hobbyist machines, the
speeds the fractured metal will reach can be a little frightening but
solid eye protection like safety glasses or a clear face shield
seriously mitigate the risks. The end mills are so lightweight that it’s
unlikely the force from an endmill will cause more than a light bruise
in a worst case scenario. If the “workpiece” or material being machined
gets thrown, that would be substantially worse. It is important to make
sure that any material being held down for machining is held strongly
enough to withstand a serious blow from a mallet. A CNC can easily exert
forces rivaling and even massively exceeding that hammer strike in
extreme circumstances. The material hazards involved in CNC machining
are generally derived from the way the CNC mill cuts material. The end
mill takes small slices as it moves across the material and some
materials, especially the soft ones, chip off in very small pieces.
Aluminum chips will often be sized as splinters and very sharp while in
stark comparison MDF or Medium-Density Fibreboard when milled often
produces micrometer fine dust. The fine dust produced when machining MDF
is dangerous because it contains high levels of formaldehyde and the
fine particles can penetrate deep into the lungs. Another example of a
material that’s dangerous to CNC machine is carbon fiber which produces
small particles that are extremely sharp causing cuts inside the lungs
and breathing tubes. Symptoms of inhaling this kind of dust are similar
to the fairly well known lung disease: silicosis. Please wear a mask
when cutting these materials at the very least.</p>

<p>With some of the scary stuff out of the way, the sheer amount of
versatility offered by CNC milling is exciting. Mills can cut almost
anything to pretty precise dimensions. But that means that materials
with huge health risks associated with their use can slip by without a
user taking the proper precautions. Always read about the materials you
are about to cut beforehand and take proper precautions.</p>

<h2 id="3-whats-next-after-hardware-and-electrical-assembly">3. What’s next after hardware and electrical assembly?</h2>

<h3 id="calibration-and-software-implementation">Calibration and software implementation</h3>

<p>This section is heavily reliant on information from part 2 of this
coursework. Especially the materials in section 5 relating to
information and communication structure of the milling machine. To
briefly review that section, a mill’s electrical control system has a
microcontroller and a computer that interact together to drive the CNC.
The computer will have control software that will parse or interpret the
CAM or toolpaths you’ve generated into serial or digital coordinate and
machine status information for the controller. Many CNC controllers,
especially older ones will be very “plug and play” because their
hardware is built to be very proprietary. Newer CNC controllers will be
built on more versatile platforms like the Arduino microcontroller which
may require finding relevant source code and uploading it to the
microcontroller. This article from Howtomechatronics
(<a href="https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/how-to-setup-grbl-control-cnc-machine-with-arduino/"><span class="underline">How to Setup GRBL &amp; Control CNC Machine with
Arduino
(howtomechatronics.com)</span></a>
is an extremely useful guide for getting a handle on putting the right
community made software on your Arduino powered CNC. The same article
goes into how to calibrate a CNC machine too. This is useful because
CNCs are very good at knowing how far they’ve traveled since they were
powered up but pretty bad at figuring out their starting position. This
is why CNC machines need to be “homed”. This is a prompted or unprompted
slow motion of each axis in a defined direction until each gets to an
origin position noted by a switch or other sensor of some kind.</p>

<h3 id="milling-machine-usage-cam-and-understanding-tooling">Milling Machine Usage, CAM, and understanding tooling</h3>

<p>Milling machines are awesome tools but they are slow and expensive. As
you become a machinist you’ll begin to see exactly where milling
machines work and what makes them more difficult and unruly. A lot of
projects will take as much time to make tool paths/CAM for as they took
to design. There are plenty of great introductory resources online to
get started, I will link a few of the resources I’ve found the most
useful and introduce the workflow of a lot of the machining operations
I’ve done.</p>

<p>Most of the CAM you’ll write for starter CNC projects will be
essentially 2.5 axis machining. Which is when you are only interested in
a 2 axis sketch with various features having only a straight extruded
depth. Think of parts that can be designed with only one sketch. Like a
flat panel with a series of holes and a special outline. The lack of
complex 3D geometry on these parts makes them comparably very easy to
design CAM for.</p>

<h4 id="some-simple-cam-tools-and-advice">Some Simple CAM tools and advice</h4>

<p>For the majority of 2.5 axis milling there are three cam operations to
consider. 2D Pocket, 2D Contour, and Engrave. 2D Pocket is the tool for
clearing large amounts of stock without making a hole. It makes simple
recessed parts quickly and efficiently. 2D Contour is for “cutting
things out.”It creates long slots as deep as the stock. It is important
when contour machining to enable the “tabs” option so the parts being
machined don’t instantly fly out.</p>

<h3 id="the-path-to-a-better-machine">The path to a better machine</h3>

<p>If you’ve decided to follow along on the hardware and electrical side of
this project and have a small budget, but reasonably capable machine or
if you’re considering taking the dive there is a long and reasonably
interesting history of improving machines to follow. A very well
designed machine tool should always be able to make a more accurate
version of itself. This process is exactly how we are able to achieve
the extreme precision of commercial machines today from the wood and
stones our ancestors used.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in how this process worked historically, or in
following along with with your own slightly optimised process check out
a series of books by a famous DIYer called David Gingery who wrote a
series of books on building a formidable machine shop with time and
materials available in dumpsters and hardware stores.</p>

<p>But what steps can I take with this specific device? Well that really
depends on your time and creativity. The pen plotter really doesn’t need
physical strength upgrades unless you want to build a bigger one. As
mentioned in section 3, our pen plotter can fairly easily be turned into
a somewhat capable milling machine. From there the mill should be able
to make ⅛” parts out of aluminum which could be used to shore up the
much less rigid 3D printed parts increasing rigidity and potentially
feedspeeds. As mentioned in section 2, there are plenty of linear motion
systems across all price ranges that could be implemented. The aluminum
extrusion in combination with steel linear bearings would be a good
combo for moving into more audacious CNC aluminum projects. Really, the
only constraints on the upwards mobility of this system are time and
money.</p>
