<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="goal-of-the-project">Goal of the Project</h2>

<p>This tutorial will introduce game development through Unity and C#
Scripting, provide the knowledge to make your own game. Unity is a
powerful game engine capable of developing all manner of video games.
Whether you are making something small for a game jam, or part of a team
making fully fledged multiplayer games, Unity has the features and
capabilities you need. The programming language Unity uses, C#, is a
powerful and modern object orientated language with capabilities
extending beyond Unity.</p>

<p>This tutorial will first explain the layout and concepts of the Unity
Editor and C# scripting then split into sections for each important
step of developing a very simple game. In each section there will be a
video showing how to go use the Unity Editor to accomplish the task,
which already has completed C# scripts. After, there will be an
explanation of each script, building up the logic and showing what that
script looks like.</p>

<h2 id="prior-knowledge">Prior Knowledge</h2>

<p>No knowledge of Unity / Visual Studio is needed, and neither is any
knowledge about C# scripting. Although not necessary, experience or
understanding of coding or game design theory is useful for
understanding these topics.</p>

<h2 id="game-demo-and-pre-made-sprites">Game Demo and Pre Made Sprites</h2>

<p>Folders containing the Sprites used in the game and an example download
of a game (where the application is the middle file) can be found in the
google drive folder linked below, along with a document walking through
the download of Unity and a zip folder of the two folders mentioned above
if needed.<br />
<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s25mtHGSSrDsAIstl6RRpmQweew1jg1s?usp=sharing">Link to Google Drive Folder</a></p>

<h1 id="installing-unity-and-visual-studio">Installing Unity and Visual Studio</h1>

<p>If you do not have Unity or Visual Studio installed, you are going to
want to install the latest versions of Unity Hub and Visual Studio.
Unity Hub acts as a medium for installing the Unity Editor along with
accessing content provided by other users. Visual Studio is an excellent
programming software that Unity integrates with to edit code and create
scripts for your game.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-the-unity-editor">Understanding the Unity Editor</h1>

<p>Before starting your project, it is important to have a basic
understanding of Unity and how to use the editor. However, the bulk of
your understanding will come from creating your game and testing things
out to figure out how it works.</p>

<h2 id="the-unity-editor">The Unity Editor</h2>

<p><em>This is a screenshot of what the Editor generally looks like</em></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>As you can see, there are four main parts of the screen</em></p>

<h3 id="the-hierarchy-upper-left">The Hierarchy (Upper Left)</h3>

<p>This part shows all the objects present in the game scene at that
moment. This could include the camera, the player, random objects like
rocks, enemies, etc. It also displays the relationship between the
objects. For example, the children of an object might be tied to the
object so that they follow as the object moves.</p>

<h3 id="the-file-system--console-bottom">The File System / Console (Bottom)</h3>

<p>This part displays the files in your game such as images, programs, or
useful tools the editor needs but you do not really need to worry about.
The file system is useful for organizing the files used by your game.
The console acts is where you can find errors displayed, as well as any
other messages created by the code as it runs. This comes in use when
you are debugging your code.</p>

<h3 id="the-game--scene-middle">The Game / Scene (Middle)</h3>

<p>This displays what your current scene looks like. It allows you to move
objects around, scale them or edit components of them. It also displays
your game when you run it so you can play it as you build it.</p>

<h3 id="the-inspector-right">The Inspector (Right)</h3>

<p>This part allows you to add components and scripts to a game object, set
variables, position objects by coordinate position, and much more. It
allows you to modify variables in your scripts before and during running
your game.</p>

<h2 id="important-concepts">Important Concepts</h2>

<h3 id="game-objects">Game Objects</h3>

<p>Game objects are a core concept in Unity. Essentially, everything that
is in a game is an object or a clone of an object. All code that is run
must be attached to a game object. Examples of game objects might be the
camera, a light source, a background image, an enemy, or any other
entity that is part of your game. All game objects have a Transform
component which means they have a position that can be set in the X Y
and Z axis, a scale on each axis, and a rotation around each axis. Game
objects do not even have to be visible; some are there purely to run
code. Values used in your script, such as player health, or ammo count,
can be changed in the editor or through scripts.</p>

<p>Game Objects that are children of another one (placed inside them in
hierarchy) will have a transform value relative to the parents instead
of space around them (so 0, 0, 0 will end up at parents position)</p>

<h3 id="components">Components</h3>

<p>These are additions to game objects you can add that handle various
things not every game object might need. For example, the Sprite
Renderer component allows a game object to show an image in its place.
The BoxCollider component allows a game object to physically interact
and collide with other game objects with a BoxCollider component or
detect when overlapping with another game object. Components are a
powerful system that allow you to add new behavior to game objects
without requiring every object to have that functionality, and without
the need to copy code between objects.</p>

<h3 id="scenes">Scenes</h3>

<p>These are the way to have different levels in a game. They are built
separately from each other and cannot interact with each because only
one scene is able to run at a time, usually. Using scripts, you can
switch between scenes, which will stop and reset the current scene, and
then load the new scene.</p>

<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>

<p>Variables are the most basic and common way of storing data. A variable
can be any kind of data. Variables have “types” which describe what kind
of data they store. Variables can store things like a number, word
(called a 'string'), component, or game object.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to represent numbers with a variable too.
Depending on the accuracy and memory you want it to have. The most
common ones are integers (numbers without any decimals) or floats
(numbers that can have decimals and are indicated with an ‘f’ at the
end)</p>

<p>A variable will usually look like this when set outside a method:</p>

<p><strong>Public Type Name</strong> (Can be accessed anywhere in the game)</p>

<p><strong>Private Type Name</strong> (Can only be accessed in the script)</p>

<p><strong>Static Public Type Name</strong> (Accessed everywhere and all instances are
the same)</p>

<p>And like this when inside a method:</p>

<p><strong>Type Name</strong> (essentially private since it is only used inside the
function)</p>

<p>Type could be something like integer or string, etc.</p>

<p>Access modifiers are the first part of these lines, the public, private,
static ones which tells the system who can use that variable and how it
can be stored. A public variable can be used anywhere in your system.
Inside its class it can be used however, and outside its call it must be
called as a child of that class.</p>

<p>For example, in the class Animal you have a public variable Hair. In the
class Animal you have some functions that use this variable and can call
it as Hair. But another class Animal2 wants to call the variable Hair,
so it must get a reference to the Animal object and then it can call the
Hair variable like Animal.Hair. This is how you call a variable or
function from a class, by placing a perioid after the class then the
variable you want.</p>

<p>A private variable can only be used in the class it is defined.</p>

<p>And a static modifier is applied to a public or private variable so that
each instance of that variable represents the same varaible, which does
have its uses. For example, let's say we have an Enemy AI and each one
needs to find and store a variable for the player's position. Each one
could calculate it, or you could use a static variable to represent the
position so only one enemy needs to find it and the rest will have the
variable updated automatically.</p>

<p>With unity, any public variable can be set in the editor to initialize
it when the game starts. Static or private ones cannot be set. Although
there is a way to force Unity to let you set them by adding [Serialized
Field] above each definition, although that is a very rare
optimization.</p>

<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>

<p>A method is a funciton that can take some variables as input, if any,
and return something, if anything, after running some lines of code
inside of it. There are some premade ones like Start (which runs its
contents once at the start of a game) or Update (which runs its contents
each frame of a game) or functions you define on your own which are
handled based on how they are called in your script. They can also
return a value such as a number or a component or even nothing (void).
This is the Start method which takes no input and returns nothing,
simply runs whatever code is inside of it once.</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Start</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Code Here  </span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is an example of another method which returns true is its input is
greater than 10, otherwise it returns false. These are boolean (bool)
values (true or false):</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="nf">Method1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">Number</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Number</span> <span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="m">10</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="scripts">Scripts</h3>

<p>This is a crucial part of unity. A script is code that you write that
can become a component for game
objects<img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here we have a script ‘FrameRate’ which represents a new Class under the
same name. Any object with this script will have an instance of this
class as a part of it.</p>

<p>It has a reference to the UnityEngine up top which means it will be
using functions or variables or classes in the Library called
UnityEngine.</p>

<p>And it has a call to MonoBehavior next to the class, which means the
FrameRate class will inherit some actions from the MonoBehavior class.
This is simply a way for Unity to make sure the classes are dealt with
correctly when instantiating objects or destroying objects to make sure
there are no errors. It is not needed for scripts that will not be
attached to objects, basically ones that are just used to store
variables across scenes, which you wont need to worry about.</p>

<p>In this class we have a public variable Rate which can be set in the
editor or in any of the scripts as long as a reference to the instance
of the script is made.</p>

<p>It has the Start method which means it will run whatever code is inside
it once for the frist frame it is active, where it will use the Rate
variable to set the frame rate of the game.</p>

<p>Then in the Update method, which runs for each frame of the game, it
checks if the frame rate has changed and then sets it back to the Rate</p>

<p>Both methods and the public variable are in the same scope, which is a
common term in programing that means they were defined in the same
place, in this case insode the class definition but not inside anything
else. This means that anything in the same scope or inside any functions
in that scope can call them without needed a reference to the class.</p>

<h1 id="setting-up-for-your-game">Setting up for Your Game</h1>

<h2 id="create-a-new-project">Create a New Project</h2>

<p>Now that we have covered the basic background information, we are ready
to start making something in Unity. We will be making a simple 2D game
so you can start by clicking new and making a new 2D project, give it a
name and choose where to save it. Exactly where you save it to is not
important.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image3.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="folders">Folders</h2>

<p>The first thing you should do if you want to stay organized is to set up
several folders to divide your assets into. Four standard folders for a
simple game like this one would be <em>Scenes</em> (which should already
exist), <em>Sprites</em>, <em>Scripts</em>, <em>Prefabs</em>. Audio is not necessary in this
case. Right click on open space in Assets or click the + to the left
while in Assets to add the folders.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image4.png" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="making-your-game">Making Your Game</h1>

<h2 id="the-player">The Player</h2>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Hute9B0Nzyc">Player</a></p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://youtube.com/embed/Hute9B0Nzyc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first essential part of making a game is setting up the player
controls and making sure it feels right to play, we will start by making
the game object for it.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image6.png" alt="" />
<img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image7.png" alt="" />
<img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To add a Game Object into your scene, there are a couple methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Click on the + to open a drop down menu, or Right Click in the open
space below the Main Camera.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this menu you can select either Empty Game Object, or select 2D
Object then select Sprite.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can also open up the GameObject menu at the top of the screen
for the drop down menu.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clicking on the new Game Object after already clicking it
(Highlighted Blue) will allow you to name it whatever you want to
distinguish it &gt;within the hierarchy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Selecting 2D &gt; Sprite will essentially make an Empty Game Object
but with a Sprite Renderer already attached to it.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Always Remember to Reset the Transform component of a new Game
Object (sometimes start off as random values)</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="player-components">Player Components</h3>

<p>Now we just need two components to make the player movement:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image9.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sprite Renderer</strong> - This simply displays an image for the object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rigidbody2D</strong> - This allows you to apply physics to an object such
as velocity in 2 Dimensions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To add components to an object you can click on the player object in the
hierarchy or in the scene view, then look over to the right in the
Inspector.</p>

<p>Then you can press the button 'Add Component' and search for <em>Sprite
Renderer</em> and <em>Rigidbody2D</em> and add each of them to the Player object.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image10.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="rigidbody2d">Rigidbody2D</h3>

<p>In the Rigidbody2D component we will need to make some changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Set the body type to Kinematic.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Dynamic means it will experience Mass and Forces applied to it
by scripts and other objects.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Kinematic means it will only have a velocity value that is set
through scripts.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set collision detection to Continuous.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Discrete means it checks for collisions less often which means
they may be missed at higher speeds.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Continuous check for collisions more often which avoids the
clipping effects.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image11.png" alt="" />
<img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image12.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="spriterenderer">SpriteRenderer</h3>

<p>In the Sprite Renderer component, we need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Open the folder section to where the player sprite is located.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then find the player object again and go to its inspector and open
Sprite Renderer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then drag the player sprite into the empty slot in Sprite Renderer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, the Sprite is not the size it should be and that is because
the pixel size Unity thinks it is has not been set.</p>

<p>We can select all the images in the sprite folder and in the inspector,
it should show some information about the sprites:</p>

<p>We should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Set the pixels per unit to 16, this can help unity with handling the
sprites but is more useful with keeping pixel art images consistent
in pixel sizes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set Filter Mode to Point (no filter) and Compression to none</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select Apply</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="player-movement-script">Player Movement Script</h3>

<p>Now we will need to create our own component for the player object to
control its movements. You can do this in multiple ways, such as
clicking to add new component to the player object in the inspector and
simply selecting new script, naming it Player Movement or something. You
may also right click in a designated folder in the file system below and
use the menu to add a new C# Script then name it accordingly.</p>

<p>In this script we will need to set a few variables to use in the Update
method which is what will happen each frame. We will need:</p>

<p><strong>public Rigidbody2D Rigidbody</strong> &lt;- A reference to the players
rigidbody component we can set through the editor</p>

<p><strong>public Vector2 Speed</strong> &lt;- A reference to a pair of values x, y we can
use to set the speed the player has on each axis</p>

<p><strong>public Vector2 Bounds</strong> &lt;- A reference to a pair of values that we
will use to limit player movement to the screen bounds</p>

<p><strong>private Vector2 Velocity</strong> &lt;- A pair of values we can use to set the
velocity of the rigidbody to, since we can't set x or y individually</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>*'public' indicates that it can be viewed and set outside the
script while 'private' only allows that within the script*</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>*The word after these is the type of variable being set, such as a
number or component or something*</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>*Then the third word represents how that variable can be called in
the script*</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This can be done outside the methods but within the class definition for
Player Movement.</p>

<p>Next, we need to think about how we will handle the logic for the
script.</p>

<p>We need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Move the Player on either axis based on Inputs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stop motion in a certain direction if it will go beyond bounds .</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A useful class we can use is the Input class which houses several
functions that get inputs from your computer. In this case we can use:</p>

<p><strong>Input.GetAxisRaw(“Horizontal”)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Input.GetAxisRaw(“Vertical”)</strong></p>

<p>This is the getAxisRaw function from the Input class which takes a
direction and returns a float number as either -1, 0 or 1 based on WASD
key inputs.</p>

<p>For example, W will return 1 for getAxisRaw("Vertical")</p>

<p>Now we need to check if moving in these directions will move us out of
bounds, we can use an if statement, which takes a boolean or comparison
as an input and runs whatver code is inside it if it is true, like so:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">transform</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">position</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="n">Input</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">GetAxisRaw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Horizontal"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span> <span class="n">Bounds</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Do Something</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Do Something Else</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, this will need to work for either direction so taking the
absolute value (from the Mathf class) of where the player will be should
work like you will see below.</p>

<p>We can put this all together to form the Player Movement Script:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image13.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is a player movement script. It starts each frame with a blank
vector and depending on whether the inputs will go out of bounds, sets
values to that vector which then is multiplied by a vector representing
the speed of the player on each axis and applied to the rigidbody's
velocity.</p>

<h2 id="the-laser">The Laser</h2>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/BRWhie3PUXY">Laser</a></p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://youtube.com/embed/BRWhie3PUXY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image14.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>What is a spaceship without lasers? First we need to create a new game
object in the hierarchy and call it Laser.</p>

<p>Laser Components</p>

<p>Now we need to figure out what components we will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SpriteRenderer</strong> to show its sprite.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rigidbody2D</strong> to move it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Add these components and remember to drag the laser sprite into the
sprite slot and set the rigidbody to kinematic and reset the transform.</p>

<h3 id="laser-movement-script">Laser Movement Script</h3>

<p>We should not need that complicated of a script for the Laser. It simply
needs to set its velocity on spawn and wait until it is out of bounds
then despawn.</p>

<p>To do so we need a reference to a Rigidbody2D, a variable to set the
speed and one for the bound as well. Then in the Start method, which is
called the first frame an object is active, we can set the velocity to
the speed. Finally, we can use the Update method to check, each frame,
that the Laser is out of bounds, and if so, destroy it, like so:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image15.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Vector2 class also houses a few variables that are instances of
Vector2's with different values representing directions. For example,
the up Vector2 is (0, 1), or up the y axis.</p>

<p>This makes it just a little simpler when setting vectors in directions
along an axis, since we want to set the velocity to going up at some
speed and now we can just have the speed as a vaiable instead of making
a new Vector2 variable.</p>

<h3 id="player-shooting-script">Player Shooting Script</h3>

<p>Now we need to have the Player shoot some lasers! First, we need to turn
the Laser object in the scene into a prefab. To do so we just drag the
Laser game object from the hierarchy into the file system. Then delete
the old object from the scene. Now the Laser will be a prefab!</p>

<p>Next, we can make a new script to add to the Player to shoot lasers,
something like PlayerShoot or Shootlaser or something.</p>

<p>There will be some new concepts here. But first we will want to set some
variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>public GameObject Laser</strong> <em>This is how you reference a prefab from
a script</em>*</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>public int CoolDown</strong> <em>This is a number we will use to wait some
frames to be able to shoot again.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>private int Timer</strong> <em>This will be used to tell if we can shoot
again.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So now, we can use the Update method to check each frame, if the Timer
is not zero decrease it. And if the space is pressed and the timer is
zero, then we can spawn some lasers in front of the player.</p>

<p>To handle the timer we can use a more compact if else statement which is
used when you want it to return a value, in this case we can use it to
return what number the timer should be subtracted by. It goes like this:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Var</span> <span class="p">-=</span> <span class="n">Var</span> <span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="m">0</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="m">1</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">0</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is a more optimized line of code than an if statement for specific
cases and is structured where before the ? Is the comparison you want
then immediately after is what you would return if it is true and after
the : is what you would return if it isnt true. And whatever is returned
takes place of what is after the =</p>

<p>To get a key press as an input we can use the GetKey function from the
Input class:</p>

<p><strong>Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Space)</strong></p>

<p>There are a few variants to the GetKey functions, there is also
GetKeyDown and GetKeyUp. Each has its own use:</p>

<p><strong>GetKey()</strong> simply returns True when the specified key is pressed on
that frame, doesn't matter how long it was pressed before.</p>

<p><strong>GetKeyDown()</strong> returns True only for the same frame that key was
pressed down.</p>

<p><strong>GetKetUp()</strong> returns True only on the frame the specified key was
released.</p>

<p>Using GetKey can allow us to have an automatic fire for our laser which
is what we will want.</p>

<p>Then to spawn in a prefab using a GameObject variable, we can use the
Instantiate function:</p>

<p><strong>Instantiate(Prefab, Vector3, Rotation);</strong></p>

<p>This will spawn the Prefab in the game with coordinates of the Vector3
parameter and rotation of the Rotation parameter.</p>

<p>In the editor make sure the script is added to the player and the laser
script is added to the Laser prefab and the variables are filled with
numbers that make sense. For example the cooldown could be 20 frames,
and the spawn point could be 3, 3 for the laser. And the Laser could
have a speed and bound of 50 or something.</p>

<h3 id="frame-rate">Frame Rate</h3>

<p>Running the game right now should allow you to move the player about and
fire lasers, however you will notice you will be firing very fast. This
is due to a frame rate not being set. To do so we can set the Target
Frame Rate in a new script called Frame Rate like below:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image16.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now you just need to attach that script to a game object like the Camera
(which is always present) and it should be running a lot smoother. Set
the rate to something like 60 like most games are. and you can also mess
around with the cooldown frames until it feels right.</p>

<h2 id="the-asteroid">The Asteroid</h2>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/u5gUrv3mPaI">Asteroid</a></p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://youtube.com/embed/u5gUrv3mPaI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image17.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now we need something to shoot at. An Asteroid moving down the screen
will do. We can create a new game object in the hierarchy named
Asteroid. It will need to move across the screen and interact with the
lasers and player. To do so we will need:</p>

<p>Asteroid Components</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SpriteRenderer</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rigidbody2D</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>BoxCollider2D</strong> &lt;- This is a new concept, it is a component that
can be used to collide with other objects, applying force to them,
or just tell if an object overlaps with another.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to reset the transform and set an asteroid sprite to the
renderer slot and set the rigidbody to kinematic and continuous, and now
you also should make sure the bounds for the collider fit the asteroid.
Click the triangle shape for the BoxCillder2D component and in the scene
view you should see the square it makes up around the object, if not
make sure the sizes aren’t 0 for the size of the collider. You can edit
these values and drag parts of the square until it feels like a correct
hitbox for it. Having the sprite active to get a visual for the size is
a good practice.</p>

<h3 id="boxcollider2d">BoxCollider2D</h3>

<p>A collider is a very important component when you want objects to
interact with each other. Note that in some cases a rigidbody will be
needed for colliders to work if physics are involved. But in this case,
we just want the collider so that we can tell if it overlaps with
another collider. To do so we can use a method called:</p>

<p><strong>void onTriggerEnter2D(Collider2d collision)</strong></p>

<p>This method has a Collider as a parameter to it because it is called
when the collider of the game object overlaps with a different collider
and that other collider is the parameter here, so that we may access it
if needed. In this method we will want to check that the object collided
with is a certain type and destroy itself if so. One way to check this
is to look at the tag of that game object. This is a word that we can
attach to any game object to differentiate it from others. It is called
like so:</p>

<p><strong>gameObject.tag</strong></p>

<h3 id="reworking-laser-logic">Reworking Laser Logic</h3>

<p>Now we can put these concepts together and form a script. However, if
you think about what this object will be doing and compare it to the
Laser, it will be very similar except for direction. We can just edit
the Laser script and generalize it, so we should be able to set the
speed to be negative and still have the bound logic work. A simple
absolute value of the position should work for that comparison.</p>

<p><strong>Mathf.Abs(Number)</strong></p>

<p>Even though the asteroid will be moving down to say -60 at -15 speed,
its position can be treated as positive, and the bounds will be positive
just in the comparison. This will work for both the Laser and Asteroid.
And we will also just need a string variable that will be the tag that
will be checked for to destroy the game object.</p>

<p>So now we can apply these changes and add the collider logic to the
Laser script like below:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image18.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And remember to add a box collider to the Laser prefab too, now that it
should have one.</p>

<p>And you should also go into the inspector for the laser and asteroid and
click on the tag button up top, this will drop down a menu where you can
add and set tags. You will want to add a Laser and Asteroid tag to use
for the respective objects for now.</p>

<h2 id="asteroid-spawning">Asteroid Spawning</h2>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/fJwzA8PrQ2A">Spawner</a></p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://youtube.com/embed/fJwzA8PrQ2A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image19.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now that we have the asteroid concept done, we will need to make a way
to spawn many of them randomly.</p>

<h3 id="spawner-object">Spawner Object</h3>

<p>We can create a new empty object in the hierarchy but this time we
won't need to add any components to it. We can just have it exist and
use it to run a script.</p>

<h3 id="spawner-script">Spawner Script</h3>

<p>We can make a new script and call it spawner or something and now we
will need to figure out some logic for it. We need to make the asteroid
into a prefab like we did with the laser to use as a reference, and to
spawn it in we will want some range of values to spawn it into since it
should be randomly around the screen, which also means we will need a
number to use as a chance to spawn it too.</p>

<p><strong>public GameObject Asteroid;</strong></p>

<p><strong>public Vector2 Rangepublic float Height</strong></p>

<p><strong>Random.Range(-10, 10)</strong> returns a random integer from -10 to 10 while
being &lt; 10</p>

<p>So, each frame we can check if a random number for some range we decide
is less than the chance we want and if it passes then spawn an asteroid
above the screen with a random x coordinate in the range, we give it,
like so:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image20.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here we can use the range as the bounds of the player and the chance
could be something like 0.05 to start but could be changed until a good
spawning rate is achieved through testing. This would mean each frame
has a 5 percent chance to spawn an asteroid, and that over 60 frames
means about 3 asteroids per second.</p>

<h2 id="health-system">Health System</h2>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/NZHLMlQwYVQ">Health</a></p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://youtube.com/embed/NZHLMlQwYVQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image21.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now that the lasers and asteroids can spawn and interact with each
other, the next step is to let the player object do the same. We will
introduce a health system to use for the player.</p>

<h3 id="health-script">Health Script</h3>

<p>So, we should have a number to represent that amount of health we have
and we can take some away every time the player collides with an
asteroid, and as most retro games do, we can make the player immune for
a small damage animation. We already know how to deal with collisions,
but we will need a new concept to handle the immunity and damage
animation. This will be the IEnumerator method, a function from the
System.Collections library we can make a reference to. These are
functions we can write that will run alongside your scripts, unaffected
by framerates. It appears similar to how other functions or methods are
defined, like so:</p>

<p><strong>IEnumerator Take_Damage()</strong></p>

<p><strong>StartCoroutine(TakeDamage())</strong></p>

<p>In this function we can make the player immune, flash the sprite on and
off, then make the player not immune. To do this we will need a way to
disable the sprite, like so:</p>

<p><strong>SpriteRenderer Sprite</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sprite.enabled = false</strong></p>

<p>You can set the enabled variable of a SpriteRenderer to true or false to
turn it on or off. And then to add some time between the flashes we will
need a way to wait some time, like so:</p>

<p><strong>yield return new WaitForSeconds(numSeconds)</strong></p>

<p>This line will cause the now branched function to wait the number of
seconds given in the parenthesis, which could even be a decimal number.
In a regular update function you would not be able to wait to continue
executing code. We could loop these concepts a few times to get the
flashing effect we want. A for loop will do. This sets a variable and it
can increment it until it reaches a limit, which is useful for looping a
set number of times. It looks like this:</p>

<p><strong>for(int i = 0; i &lt; MaxNumber; i++)</strong></p>

<p>This sets a new variable ‘i’ to zero and increments it by 1 (i++) and
runs whatever code is inside it until ‘i’ does not satisfy the
conditional (i &lt; MaxNUmber) in the middle. This can cause us to run the
code inside the for loop a certain number of times.</p>

<p>Putting all these concepts together we can form the Health script for
the player like so:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image22.png" alt="" title="Inserting image..." /></p>

<h3 id="health-bar">Health Bar</h3>

<p>Now that the player has a health value, we can set a visual on screen to
show it. This will simply be a Sprite on screen that has its image
changed each time the player's health is updated. To do this we can add
two variables to the health script, a SpriteRenderer that is a reference
to the sprite on screen, and an array of Sprite images we can swap to.
An array is like a list of elements with a fixed size, and you can
access each member of that list through an index. It appears like so:</p>

<p><strong>public int[ ] Numbers</strong> *This is an unset variable that references
an array of integers.*</p>

<p><strong>int Variable = Numbers[3]</strong> *This is how you can call a certain
element from the array.*</p>

<p>We can set a public array through the editor so no need to worry about
initializing it through the script. There are cases where that would
happen and in those cases there are functions that can find certain
objects or components and returns an array you can use to set it.</p>

<p>So now that we can use an array of Sprites that contain health bars that
relate to different levels of health, we can figure out a clever way to
index it such that we can use the health as an index. This means that
since the amount of bar variations or the length of the array should be
equal to how much health the player has, we can use the health amount as
a way to access the health bar associated with the amount. For example
if health is 0, then we can use the sprite at 0 index in the array, and
with health 1 we can sue index 1, etc. To make an array of sprites we
can just do this:</p>

<p><strong>public Sprite[ ] Sprites</strong></p>

<p>With this logic, whenever the player health is updated, we can just set
the health bar sprite to whatever sprite is at the index in the array of
the new health amount, as seen in the updated health script:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/imgs/UnityGame/image23.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="exporting">Exporting</h2>

<p>Before exporting it is a good idea to add a line of code to a script
that is always active that will let you quit out of the game without
having to manually close the application. We can use this line of code
in an update function, probably the frame rate one:</p>

<p><strong>If (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Escape)) Application.Quit();</strong></p>

<p>There is much more you could do to add to this game, or any game, but
eventually you are going to want to make a build for it whether it is
finished or not, to see what the finished product would look like at
this moment, or to save a previous copy of a game you may be updating.
To build your game, or export the application into a file, you can go
into the menu through file and click build settings.</p>

<p>Here you will see the scenes the game thinks it should export and how
Unity will export it, such as how it will be windowed or what platform
it will be for. If the scene you want is not in the build, make sure to
click 'add open scenes' and then click build. This should then work on
exporting your game into your computer's file system that you can play
outside of Unity.</p>
